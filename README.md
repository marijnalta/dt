# Whatsapp media analysis

This python program analyses whatsapp group chats using jupyter notebook.

## How to use
- Download the .ipynb file and make sure you have installed jupyter notebook (https://jupyter.org/).
- Download the .txt log of your whatsapp group chat (https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/android/23756533/, download without media).
- Rename the chat log to chat.txt.
- Move to the directory where the .ipynb and .txt file are stored and enter 'jupyter notebook' in your terminal.
- The content of this directory will be displayed in your browser. Open the .ipynb file.
- Run the parts of code (especially the first bit, because it reads the .txt log at the top).

Only works with dutch whatsapp chat logs.
